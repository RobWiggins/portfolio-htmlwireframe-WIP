      <h2 id="welcome" role="banner">Welcome to my humble corner of the internet.</h3>
      <h2 id='about-me'>Who are you anyways? Give me the facts.</h2>
      <p> A graduate from UNC Chapel Hill’s undergraduate Kenan-Flagler business school ’16, I am transitioning from a background in business, investment management, and corporate client advisory to a career in software and web development.  Having taken most of the intermediate-level programming (Java, C) and CS math courses through NC State University, I have built a fundamental base through which to expand my knowledge of software engineering. Thinkful’s demanding Full Stack web development Immersion program, of which I am currently a student, develops core front and back-end skills in JavaScript, React, jQuery, Node, SQL, HTML5, CSS3 and the server-side. I will complete the program in late September.</p>
      <h2>My story</h2>
      <p>When I began college at UNC Chapel Hill, I was under the impression that the STEM fields were reserved for the sporadic geniuses of the world to conquer. Aren’t I supposed to have a high GPA to get a job? My eventual choice of corporate finance and investment management fulfilled a certain technical requirement that my mind unconsciously gravitated towards. The flow and distribution of capital are the metaphorical infrastructure of society. Through a variety of corporate advisory and investment roles, I learned key lessons about how the world operates, developed a sharpened eye for customer needs, and gained proficiency personally serving clients on the front line.</p>
      <img id="crossroads_stick" src="images/stickman_STEM_with_comments.jpg" alt="A crossroads between a stormy cliff for the STEM field and a sunny grass field for 'higher gpa'.">
      <p>Yet a piece of me that yearned for deeper technical challenges nagged daily. A plateau of the learning curve on the horizon is disheartening. At the pace this field is growing, I'm not sure such a thing exists. I love solving problems. I love building things. I love programming. It's amazing that I may be able to do all at once. I hope to forge these passions through the lens of a trained business eye to help my future teammates succeed.</p>
      <h2>My philosophy</h2>
      <p>Software is notoriously difficult to get right. I’ve realized that I thrive on failing often then succeeding often, doing my best to maintain evenness of mind throughout. The more we fail when pushing boundaries, the more we learn. I’m a strong believer that leaping from failure to failure with undiminished enthusiasm fosters peak performance and astonishing growth. Don’t take this too personally, but I hope to fail with you too. Then we can create something wonderful.</p>
